Simple logging framework in `C++23`.

This isn't meant to be a *one-size fits all* solution, nor is it meant to the best at doing what does.

I do hope to provide atleast the following

- Thread safe output
- Formatted text (using the standard library)
    - Compile-time checking
    - Format log message and output
- Configurable output targets
- Configurable log filtering
- Zero overhead when disabled at compile-time
